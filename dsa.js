/* ALgorithm */
/******************/
/* An Algorithm is a set of instructions or steps for solving problem */

/* Why you should learn algorithm */
/* 
1. critical thinking and abstruction(something hidden from general user)
2. problem solving
3. computer science
4. career advancment
5. understanding new technology

*/

/* time complexcity, space complexcity */
/* time complexcity is a way to analyze the total time or performance of an algorithm */

/* space complexcity is a way to analyze the total space or memory need for an algorithm */

/* asymptotic notation : this is a mathematical method. by this method we can describe or calculate time complexcity and space complexcity  */

/* asymtotic notation are mainly three types: 
1. big o notation
2. big omega notation
3. big theta notation
 */

/*symbol of big o notation: O()  */
